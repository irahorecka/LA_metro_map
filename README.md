# LA_metro_map
A repository for plotting real-time LA Metro bus coordinates on a map

Simply, run the entirety of metro_mapping.ipynb and exit main() when you are satisfied with the image accumulation (which will accumulate in the ```./map_figs``` directory).

Then, run the entirety of gif_generator.ipynb and follow the prompts. This will create a .gif of your images in the ```./gif_files``` directory.
